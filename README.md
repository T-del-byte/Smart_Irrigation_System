# Smart_Irrigation_System
# Objective
The objective of a smart irrigation system is to optimize water usage by automatically monitoring soil moisture, weather conditions, and crop requirements, ensuring efficient and sustainable irrigation. This reduces water wastage, lowers costs, and promotes healthier plant growth.
# Tools & technologies
ARDUINO UNO R3  
JUMPER WIRES  
SOIL MOISTURE SENSOR  
MINI MOTOR  
RELAY  CIRCUIT  
# Working Principle
A smart irrigation system works on the principle of feedback control. It uses real-time data from environmental sensors (such as soil moisture, temperature, and weather data) to make automatic decisions about when and how much water to apply to the plants. The system continuously monitors conditions and adjusts irrigation based on the feedback received, ensuring optimal water usage while avoiding over-irrigation or under-irrigation. This principle helps maintain an efficient, adaptive system that meets the needs of the plants while conserving water.
# Constrction
1. **Connect Soil Moisture Sensor:** Insert the sensor into soil and connect its analog output pin to the Arduinoâ€™s A0, VCC to 5V, and GND to GND.  
2. **Connect Relay Module:** Link the relay's signal pin to a digital pin (e.g., D7), VCC and GND to 5V and GND, and connect NO/COM pins to the motor's power supply and motor.  
3. **Connect Mini Motor:** Connect the motor to the relay as described, ensuring proper power supply.  
4. **Upload Code:** Upload the code to the Arduino via the IDE after connecting the board to the computer.  
5. **Test System:** Test by placing the sensor in dry soil to activate the pump, and water the soil to turn the motor off when moisture is sufficient.  
# Output
The output of the smart irrigation system is the automatic activation and deactivation of the water pump based on soil moisture levels.
# Future Improvements
It include integrating weather forecasts, incorporating wireless communication for remote control, using machine learning for better water usage predictions, and adding solar-powered components for energy efficiency.
# Applications
It is used in agriculture to optimize water usage, reduce wastage, and improve crop yield by automating irrigation based on soil moisture levels.
